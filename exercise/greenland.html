      <h2>Greenland</h2>
      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>Greenland, the world's largest island, is about 80% ice capped. 
        The Inuit came to Greenland from North America in a series of migrations 
        that stretched from 2500 BC to the11th century. Vikings reached the island 
        in the 10th century from Iceland; Danish colonization began in the 18th century, 
        and Greenland became part of the Kingdom of Denmark in 1953. It joined the European 
        Community (now the EU) with Denmark in 1973 but withdrew in 1985 over a dispute 
        centered on stringent fishing quotas. Greenland remains a member of the EU's Overseas 
        Countries and Territories Association. The Danish parliament granted Greenland home rule in 1979; 
        the law went into effect the following year. Greenland voted in favor of self-government in 2008 
        and acquired greater responsibility for internal affairs when the Act on Greenland Self-Government 
        was signed into law in 2009. The Kingdom of Denmark, however, continues to exercise control over 
        several policy areas on behalf of Greenland, including foreign affairs, security, and financial 
        policy, in consultation with Greenland's Self-Rule Government.</p>
